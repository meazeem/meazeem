Hi,

I’m a seasoned C++ developer with over 14 years of hands-on experience in telecom systems, messaging protocols, and backend architecture. 
I’ve built and deployed a full-featured RCS platform from scratch, including interworking with SMSC/MMSC, store-and-forward messaging, and support for RBM features like verified sender profiles and chatbots.

If you're looking for someone who deeply understands SIP/MSRP messaging flows, performance optimization, and protocol compliance under production loads—I can help architect, build, or debug your system with confidence.

Let’s connect to discuss how I can bring value to your project.

Thanks,
